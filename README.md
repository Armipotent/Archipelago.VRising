# Archipelago V Rising Client

HEAVY WIP. Will need documentation. Yes, the skeleton of this readme is stolen from [Archipelago.RiskOfRain2](https://github.com/Ijwu/Archipelago.RiskOfRain2/).

Inspiration for implementation will be coming from Terraria and Risk of Rain 2, among others.

## Gameplay

## YAML Settings

An example YAML would look like this:
```yaml
description: Armi-VRising
name: Armi

game: V Rising
V Rising:
  
```

| Name | Description | Allowed Values |
| ---- | ----------- | -------------- |
| | |

## Connecting to an Archipelago Server

## Changelog

## Known Issues
